# Global Data Science Trends & Skills Demand Analysis

# Summary 
In this project, The dataset goes through data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis. The main focus was to transform raw survey data into a structured, consistent, and analyzable form, followed by generating meaningful insights about respondents’ behaviors, skills, and preferences.

# Steps Performed
1.	Dataset Loading & Exploration
o	Loaded the Kaggle Data Science Survey dataset using Pandas.
o	Checked dataset dimensions, column names, and data types to understand the structure.
o	Inspected the first few rows to get an overview of available features.

2.	Data Cleaning
o	Handled Missing Values
	Checked for null values in all columns.
	Applied strategies like removal of irrelevant rows and imputation (where necessary).
o	Removed Duplicates
	Identified and removed duplicate entries to avoid data bias.
o	Fixed Inconsistent Formatting
	Standardized categorical values (e.g., country names, job titles) for consistency.
o	Encoding Categorical Data
	Applied label encoding / mapping to convert categorical variables into numeric form for analysis.

3.	Feature Engineering
o	Created new features where necessary (e.g., skill count, experience grouping).
o	Grouped certain survey answers into broader categories for better visualization.

4.	Data Analysis & Insights Generation
o	Skills Analysis: Identified the most in-demand data science skills by counting their frequency in responses.
o	Location-wise Trends: Compared skill demand across different cities/countries.
o	Role Preferences: Checked which job titles respondents prefer and their distribution.
o	Experience Insights: Analyzed how experience levels affect skillsets and salary expectations.

5.	Data Visualization
o	Plotted bar charts for top skills in demand.
o	Created location-wise skill frequency charts to understand regional trends.
o	Used Matplotlib to create clear and visually appealing charts for results presentation.

# Outcome:
•	The dataset was cleaned, standardized, and ready for further modeling or advanced analytics.
•	Generated actionable insights, such as top technical skills, their demand in different regions, and role-based trends.
•	Created visual reports that make the findings easy to understand for stakeholders.
